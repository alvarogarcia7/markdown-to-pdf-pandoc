# Tool: Markdown to PDF

Purpose: Create PDFs from my MDs.

Motivation: 

  * Do this conversion offline
  * Create documents that are suitable for clients.

## Usage

For now, the goals should be used together:

```
make install #only the first time
FILE="your_file.md" make convert
```

## Alternatives

See the project [markdown-to-pdf](https://github.com/alvarogarcia7/markdown-to-pdf).
